Hello, I'm Emir. I am currently studying at a high school on informatics. 
I am currently taking Web software, Mobile software and Graphic design courses due to my school. 
But apart from that, I know Access as an intermediate level C# and C# Database, unfortunately I don't know mysql right now, 
but mysql is noted in my list that I will learn in the future. 
There are small projects that I have done before (it should be around 5 - 6 months) by myself, but I haven't added them to Github, 
I will add them if I find them. Logic follow-up programs of the projects; Whether cargo tracking, Litigation tracking, Queue tracking, 
Ticket reservation etc. projects like this. Apart from these, I have never been a partner or participated in any project before. Lastly, 
as I said, I want to improve myself on the back-end and I am working on it.
